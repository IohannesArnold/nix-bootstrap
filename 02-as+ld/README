The order here is a bit tricky, so this README explains.
1) as-ts-v2.nix runs to compile the stage 2 assembler.
2) as-v2.nix runs to turn the object file into an executable.
3) as-ts.nix runs to compile the stage 3 assembler from stage2.
4) as-v2_5.nix runs to turn the object file into an executable.
5) ld-ts.nix runs to compile the linker.
6) ld-v2_5.nix runs to turn the object file into an executable.
7) default.nix builds both tools from themselves.
